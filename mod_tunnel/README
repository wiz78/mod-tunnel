mod_tunnel                http://mod-tunnel.sourceforge.net 


What is it?
===========

mod_tunnel is a simple Apache 2.2.x module that can be
used to create TCP tunnels using your web server. It comes 
handy to expose services which can be reached through a 
proxy, bypassing firewalls.


Who did it?
===========

Show your support
=================

If you use this software in a production environment and/or
you wish to show your support, you can get me something off
my Amazon wish-list, located at 

http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/registry/1K4OWZ581SIRE/ref%3Dwl%5Fs%5F3/026-2575462-0900418

In any case, have fun with it :)


Installation
============

If apxs is not in the path, edit the Makefile and modify
the APXS variable.

Then "make install" should compile and install the module into
the correct apache directory.


Configuration
=============

The module adds these configuration directives:

   TunnelEnabled     if set to "on" (without quotes) mod_tunnel will
                     be enabled for the current virtual host

   TunnelHost        the hostname of the tunnel target

   TunnelPort        the port to connect to


The idea is to setup a different virtual host for every service you
wish to expose (beware: no authentication has been implemented,
anyone can connect - Apache's authentication may prevent unauthorised
access: too bad that the current client doesn't support it ;-)

For instance:

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName     ssh.mydomain.com
    TunnelEnabled  on
    TunnelHost     localhost
    TunnelPort	   22
</VirtualHost>
