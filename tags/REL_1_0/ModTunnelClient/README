Show your support
=================

If you use this software in a production environment and/or
you wish to show your support, you can get me something off
my Amazon wish-list, located at 

http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/registry/1K4OWZ581SIRE/ref%3Dwl%5Fs%5F3/026-2575462-0900418

In any case, have fun with it :)


Installation
============

This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project
for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit. (http://www.openssl.org/)

To support https, this program needs the OpenSSL dll's.
Since there might be some restrictions in distributing them,
due to laws about strong cryptography which may exist in your
country, it's up to you to get hold of a working copy of them.
Don't ask me, sorry.

Anyway, you may try the ones you can find here:

Configuration
=============

Edit ModTunnelClient.ini to setup the host to connect to and 
the details of your proxy (if needed).
